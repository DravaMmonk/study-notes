Agents - Sensors/Precepts -> Actuators/Actions

Planning - How to combine a set of functions to achieve goals: From every initial state to their optimal goals
- State Space - **Finite** and **Discrete**
- Every function costs/is deterministic
- A solution is a sequence of applicable actions that maps s₀ into SG
- It is **optimal =** if it minimises sum of action costs (lowest cost)

SAT - Satisfiability  
CSP - Constraint Satisfaction Problem**
